# Hi there! 👋

I'm Keshav K Das, a beginner Computer Science student exploring the world of coding! 🚀 I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building cool projects.

## 🔥 About Me
- 🎓 Currently learning programming and CS fundamentals
- 💻 Interested in Python, Web Development, and Data Structures
- 🌱 Always looking to improve my coding skills

## 📌 My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. Photo sharing app - A cloud-based photo-sharing platform that allows users to upload, share, and manage images securely using AWS services. 
2. Attendance system - The BLE Attendance System project aims to automatically update attendance using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This is my first prototype, and it utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller that acts as a BLE beacon, scanning for nearby devices. 
3. Ai study companion - StudyAI is a modern web application designed to enhance your study experience with three powerful tools: Flashcards, a Pomodoro Timer, and a Notes system. Built with React and TypeScript, it offers a clean, intuitive interface for effective learning.

More projects coming soon! 🚀
